Incomplete list of stuff to do:
- When start()ing a Torrent that was previously stop()ed it seems no or
  few peers get picked up and so nothing is downloaded.
- Don't spam trackers with announces when we're lacking peers
- Algorithm to decide when to send choke and interested messages to peers
- Algorithm to decide if and when peers request messages should be answered
- Make the Qt GUI usable
- DHT Support (see BEP 0005)
- PEX Support (see https://trac.transmissionbt.com/browser/trunk/extras/extended-messaging.txt)
- More tests
- More documentation
- Write CONCEPTION file once the conception is done.
- find . -name "*.java"|xargs grep -E '(TODO|FIXME|HACK|PROJECT)'

- Check usage of trackerid in HTTPAnnouce
