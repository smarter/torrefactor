Incomplete list of stuff to do:
- Use trackerid in HTTPAnnouce
- Algorithm to decide when to send "choked" messages to peers
- Algorithm to decide if and when peers request messages should be answered
- PeerManager is a mess and needs a rewrite
- PieceManager: The rarity of a piece should determine its download priority (currently we download them iteratively)
- TrackerManager: Do announce in parallels
- DHT support is completely untested
- Make the Qt GUI usable
- PEX Support (see https://trac.transmissionbt.com/browser/trunk/extras/extended-messaging.txt)
- find . -name "*.java"|xargs grep -E '(TODO|FIXME|HACK|PROJECT)'
