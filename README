## Torrefactor 0.1 - A BitTorrent client written in Java ##
This application is a client for the BitTorrent P2P protocol which allows file
sharing. It can be used to create new ".torrent" files to share and to download
existing ".torrent" files. You can find ".torrent" files on torrents search
engine such as http://thepiratebay.org and http://torrentz.eu.

* Build core and tests:
make

* Run the Swing GUI:
. ./env
java torrefactor.ui.swing.SwingClient
Use "File -> Open" to choose a .torrent file
Use the right-click menu to start or stop downloading the selected torrent.
Use "File -> Options..." to configure Torrefactor:
- "Use encryption" adds support for the (completely unsafe(see CONCEPTION)!)
  encryption protocol used for the project.
- "Force encryption" forces Torrefactor to only communicates with peers who
  support the same encryption protocol as we.
- "Enable DHT" adds support for DHT(Distributed Hash Table) which is a
  BitTorrent extension which allows you to get more peers (see
  http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html for more informations)
- "Download directory:" lets you choose the directory in which the downloaded
  files should be stored.

* Run tests:
make runtest

* Run the test client:
. ./env
java test.Client <input.torrent> <output directory>

* Generate the doc:
make doc

* Build and run the experimental and not usable Qt GUI:
- Install QtJambi and get the jar into your $CLASSPATH
make src.torrefactor.ui.qt
. ./env
java torrefactor.ui.qt.Main


* Run the BitTorrent decrypter.
- This is a small program that will decrypt the encrypted XOR key sent
by both peers when encryption is enabled and use it to decode the
first message of each peer. This relies on a critical flaw of the
encryption scheme: The XOR key is encrypted with RSA byte per byte.
This means that there's only 256 different keys. 
- You need libssl and libnids as dependencies, on Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libnids-dev
make btsniff
sudo ./btsniff <network interface>
- For exemple, to test in local:
sudo ./btsniff lo
