## Torrefactor 0.1 - A BitTorrent client written in Java ##
This application is a client for the BitTorrent P2P protocol which allows file
sharing. It can be used to create new .torrent files to share and to download
existing .torrent files. You can find .torrent files on torrents search
engine such as http://thepiratebay.org and http://torrentz.eu.

* Features:
- HTTP and UDP trackers support
- Torrents with multiple files support
- Creating new .torrent files
- DHT support
- Save the program state when it closes in .torrefactor/config.bin in the user's
  home directory.
- Save the configuration options in .torrefactor/config

* Build core and tests:
make

* Run the Swing GUI:
make jar
java -jar torrefactor.jar
- If you don't want to make a JAR, you could instead do:
. ./env
java torrefactor.ui.swing.SwingClient

Use "File -> Open" to choose a .torrent file
Use the right-click menu to start or stop downloading the selected torrent.
Use "File -> Options..." to configure Torrefactor:
- "Use encryption" adds support for the (completely unsafe(see CONCEPTION)!)
  encryption protocol used for the project.
- "Force encryption" forces Torrefactor to only communicates with peers who
  support the same encryption protocol as we.
- "Enable DHT" adds support for DHT(Distributed Hash Table) which is a
  BitTorrent extension which allows you to get more peers (see
  http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0005.html for more informations)
- "Download directory:" lets you choose the directory in which the downloaded
  files should be stored.

* Run the tests:
. ./env
make runtest

* Run the test command line client:
. ./env
java test.Client <input.torrent> <output directory>

* Generate the doc:
make doc

* Build and run the experimental and not usable Qt GUI:
- Install QtJambi and get the jar into your $CLASSPATH
make src.torrefactor.ui.qt
. ./env
java torrefactor.ui.qt.Main


* Run the BitTorrent decrypter (see CONCEPTION).
- You need libssl and libnids as dependencies, on Debian/Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libnids-dev
make btsniff
# Root privileges are needed to capture network traffic
sudo ./btsniff <network interface>
- For exemple, to test in local:
sudo ./btsniff lo
